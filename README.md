# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of kickstarter campaigns to determine optimal fundraising potential. This repository includes deliverables in support of the project.

## Background
Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? In this challenge, you’ll conduct a data analysis to answer this question and determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

## Objectives

* Use filters and Excel formula to create new datasets
* Create visualizations using Excel charts and pivot tables
* Interpret the summary data provided from the visualizations

### Challenge
Analysis of the Kickstarter data shows successful campaigns in the plays subcategory regardless of the length of the campaign. However, the vast majority of successfull campaigns have a length between 21 and 40 days.

We also find the highest distribution of successfull campaigns in the summer between the months of May and July.

Goal amount is a significant factor in the success/failure of a campaign. We find the largest distribution of successfull campaigns in the plays subcategory range between $1,000 and $4,999 dollars.

Based on these observations we recommend launching new kickstarter campaigns for a play in May with a campaign lenght between 21 and 40 days and a goal under $5,000. However, the reader should be a aware of limitations in the dataset. The analysis focus exclusively on plays. Campaigns in other categories show different characteristics than the recommendations for plays. Also, the data does not drill down to the genre of the plays in the category. It is possible that the subject and target audience of the play affects it viability within the kickstarted user base. 

For further analysis we recommend visualizations to plot the relationship between the number of backers and the success of the campaign. The current analysis does not provide insights into the range of backers required to achive a succesful campaign on average. Furthermore, the analysis does not look at the relationship between staff pick and average contribution. It is possible that a recommendation from the staff can drive the number of backers and average donation.
